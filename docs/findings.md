# Findings

This file records every review finding, bug report and known problem: what was found, and where it stands. A finding that exists only in a conversation gets lost, and a decision that is not written down gets made again.

**This file holds the open findings.** A closed row (status starting `fixed`, `built`, `decided`, `closed`,
`accepted`, ...) is moved, byte for byte and with its number, to
`history/findings_closed_0001-0250.md` and so on ([index](history/README.md)) -- one file per 250 numbers.
A reference such as "#726" is found by its number there. The owner's decisions are collected in
[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md); the rules that came out of findings are in [INVARIANTS.md](INVARIANTS.md).

- **Add a row when something is found**, before fixing it.
- **Severity** *(owner, 2026-10-09; CLAUDE.md, "Keeping the project small")*: start the Finding with `data:` (can lose or
  corrupt data), `wrong:` (a wrong result the owner sees) or `low:`. Only `data` and `wrong` block a merge; `low` rows are
  batched. Older rows carry none.
- **Status** is one of:
  - `open`
  - `fixed`: give the commit, by its hash or, for a row added in the same commit, its subject.
  - `not reproduced`: say what was tried.
  - `left as is`: say why.
  - `tabled`: say until when.
  - `planned`: give the phase in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Decisions the owner makes** are marked *(owner, date)*. Don't reopen them without a new fact.
- **Never put real names here.** The library is photographs of real people.
- **Numbering is the main session's.** A worker does not number rows into this file (two branches that both do collide on
  merge). It writes `| ? |` rows with `tools/add_findings.py rows.md --branch-file docs/findings_pending/<branch>.md`
  (provisional `B-1`, `B-2`; never write a `B-n` into code or a commit message) and the main session, merging the branch,
  runs `tools/add_findings.py --take docs/findings_pending/<branch>.md`, which numbers the rows after the highest number
  in this file **and the archives**, and removes the file. `tools/add_findings.py --status N "fixed: abc"` sets a status
  (in the archive if the row is there); `--archive` moves the rows whose status closed.

Findings fixed before 2026-09-23 are in the git log (`git log --grep="^fix"`). This file starts with what was still open or decided on that day.

| # | Found | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2026-09-23 | Faces are detected on the photo as stored, so a sideways photo (about 1 in 600, more as photos are rotated) is searched sideways. A rotated TIFF also keeps the embedding of its old turn. Detecting upright changes the coordinate system of stored face boxes, the crops, and the rotate logic. | open: owner to confirm: wanted after the feature freeze (DECISIONS 2026-10-07 un-tabled the redesign: boxes stored as the photo displays; the 2026-10-09 freeze defers it; its fingerprint half is wanted after the freeze, DECISIONS 2026-10-15 Files (6)); meanwhile /api/photo-faces says 'turned' and the panel says so |
| 831 | 2026-10-07 | #791 known limit: a photo stored with EXIF Orientation 2-8 has its boxes drawn at the stored pixels' positions on the turned picture; /api/photo-faces says `turned` and the panel says so. | open: owner to confirm: the same redesign as #1 (wanted after the feature freeze?) |
