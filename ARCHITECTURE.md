Where the code is going, why, and in what order. Agreed 2026-09-23. Known problems and review findings are tracked in [docs/findings.md](docs/findings.md).

[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) covers how to work in the code as it is today. This covers the shape it is moving to. For new code, this document wins.

## Why change

TagPup is organized by program: a TagPup server (`scripts/tagpup_server.py`, 4,088 lines), a TagTuner server (`scripts/tuner_server.py`, 5,326 lines), a CLI, a desktop runner, and 28 more modules in `scripts/`. Each carries its own copy of what a photo library is and does. On 2026-09-23:

- The two servers held 215 SQL calls and 74 routes, and 51 function names were defined in both. Eight TagTuner routes were never called by its own page; only tests reached them.
- ExifTool was opened from 22 places, images from 10 (with different orientation handling), and `config.ini` was read in 26.
- The database mixed copies of file metadata, decisions that exist nowhere else, and derived data, without saying which is which. `photos.people` was missing 1,626 names across the two libraries.
- A photo's identity was its path, so every rename had to re-point faces, embeddings and suggestions by hand.

Nearly every bug fixed that day had one of four shapes:

1. Many writers, no owner.
2. One fact stored in several places.
3. State cached in one process while three processes write the same database.
4. "Success" meaning "I tried".

Each time the codebase gained a single owner with a guard test (`db.py`, `paths.py`, `exiftool_session.py`, the tag vocabulary), a class of bug ended. This design does that for everything, on purpose, instead of after the fourth bug.

## Principles

1. **One owner per concern.** Every concern (a table, a file format, a rule) has exactly one module that implements it, and everything else calls that module. A guard test enforces each owner.
2. **Three kinds of data, one writer each.**
   - *File copies:* keywords, captions, dates, orientation, raw metadata, DocumentID. The photo file is the truth and the row is a cache of it. Only `sync_photo()` writes these, straight after a file is read or written.
   - *Decisions:* faces, the names people give them, exclusions, the tag tree. They exist only in the database and change only through services.
   - *Derived data:* people lists, embeddings, face crops, the vector index, Identify grids, suggestions, thumbnails. Feature code never writes them. One function rebuilds each, or it is computed on read, and caches are keyed by generation.
3. **A photo has an id.** Rows refer to photos by integer id, and the path is an attribute. A rename is one update.
4. **Every write reports what it changed.** Service functions return a `Result`: changed, attempted, skipped, errors.
5. **Context is explicit.** A `Library` object is passed to whatever needs it. There are no thread-locals and no class-level registries keyed by an implicit current library.
6. **Caches are keyed by library and generation.** Database triggers bump a generation when the data a cache depends on changes, whichever process changes it.
7. **The app you use runs from an installed copy, not the working tree.** Editing code never restarts it.

## Layers

```
   TagPup page    TagTuner page            web/: ES modules sharing web/common/

                 |                                         |
                 |                     jobs (tagpup.jobs): queue, status,
                 |                     cancel, worker processes for GPU work
                 v                                         v
        services (tagpup.services): one function per user action; the only writers
                 |
     +-----------+-----------+-------------+
     v           v           v             v
   core        store       files           ml
   rules       SQL         photo files     models
```

Imports only go down:

| Layer | Package | Owns | May import |
|---|---|---|---|
| core | `tagpup.core` | Pure rules: path identity, a library's name and the files that belong to it (`Library`), the tag vocabulary (leaf, root, person), people derivation, suggestion scoring, clustering decisions | nothing but `core` |
| config | `tagpup.config` | `TAGPUP_HOME`, `config.ini` and what it says: where the libraries are, which ExifTool, model settings, the library to open next. Read by entry points, which pass the values down | nothing |
| logs | `tagpup.logs` | Each program's log file in `data/logs/`. Set up by entry points | `config` |
| store | `tagpup.store` | The library database: connections and locks, schema and migrations, generations, one repository per table, caches keyed by generation, backups | `core` |
| files | `tagpup.files` | The photo files: ExifTool sessions, reading metadata, writing keyword, caption and orientation fields, identities, opening images (upright or as stored), crops and thumbnails | `core` |
| ml | `tagpup.ml` | Models: CLIP embeddings, face detection and embeddings, the vector index | `core`, `files` |
| services | `tagpup.services` | One function per user action. The only code that writes. Returns a `Result` | all of the above |
| jobs | `tagpup.jobs` | Background work: queue, status, cancel, persistence, worker processes for GPU work | `core`, `services` |
| entry points | `tagpup.web`, `tagpup.cli`, `tagpup.mcp`, `scripts/`, `tools/` | HTTP, the command line, the MCP server Claude works through, maintenance and development tools | `config`, `logs`, `services`, `jobs` (and `core` for formatting) |

Guard tests, each of which fails the build. The ones marked *exists* are in place; the rest arrive with their phase.

- Imports inside `tagpup/` go down the layers, and package code never imports an old module from `scripts/` by name. *Exists:* `tests/test_layers.py`.
- `sqlite3.connect` only in `tagpup.store.db`. *Exists:* `tests/test_db_access.py`.
- pyexiftool's classes constructed only in `tagpup.files.exiftool_session`. *Exists:* `tests/test_exiftool_single_owner.py`.
- Photo paths spelled and compared only by `tagpup.core.paths`. *Exists:* `tests/test_paths_single_owner.py`.
- Tags taken apart only by `tagpup.core.vocabulary`. *Exists:* `tests/test_vocabulary.py`.
- SQL only inside `tagpup.store`. *Exists:* `tests/test_sql_single_owner.py`.
- `config.ini` read, and path settings resolved, only by `tagpup.config`; inside `tagpup/`, only it finds folders from `__file__`. *Exists:* `tests/test_config_single_owner.py`.
- ExifTool and `Image.open` only inside `tagpup.files`.
- Entry points import services and jobs, never store, files or ml directly.
- Every POST route returns a `Result`.
- Derived tables written only by their rebuild functions.
- Pages: `/api/` URLs built only by `web/common/api.js`. Tags split only by the vocabulary helpers (*exists:* `tests/frontend/tag-vocabulary.test.mjs`).

Every guard checks the same list of files, `tests/shipped_sources.py`: the launchers, `scripts/`, and `tagpup/`.

## Runtime

- **One server, two apps.** One Flask app, served by Waitress, answers on both ports used today: 8090 for TagPup, 8080 for TagTuner. The library comes from the URL as it does now, and becomes a `Library` object for the request. The Host and Origin check is a `before_request` hook.
- **Background jobs** (indexing, suggestions, clustering, refresh) run through one job runner per library, with status, cancel and persistence. GPU-heavy work runs in a worker process, as indexing does today through the CLI.
- **The installed copy.** `scripts/install_app.py` copies the code into a version folder under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TagPup` and writes launchers that run it. `TAGPUP_HOME` names the folder that holds `config.ini` and `data/`, with each library's backups and locks beside it. Updating is a deliberate step, installing again, and the two versions before stay to go back to. The auto-reloader is for development only.
- **Logs** go to `data/logs/`, one rotating file per program. Each holds everything the console shows, plus every request slower than a second with its time, and every failed request with its traceback.

## Data model

| Table | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `photos` | file copy | `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY; `path` UNIQUE, compared without case; `document_id`; `mtime`, `size`; `keywords`, `captions`, `raw_metadata`, `taken_at`, `orientation` as read from the file; `indexed_at`, NULL until indexed. Every photo the apps have looked at has a row, because faces need one to point at (today the suggester saves faces for photos with no row). |
| `faces` | decision | `id`; `photo_id` → `photos.id`; `box`; `embedding`; `name`; `name_source`; `excluded`; `excluded_reason`. |
| `face_crops` | derived | `face_id` → `faces.id`; the JPEG. Kept out of `faces`, so reading faces never drags 6 KB crops along. |
| `photo_people` | derived | `photo_id`, `name`, `source` (keyword or face). Rebuilt for a photo by one function whenever its keywords, its faces or the tag tree change. Replaces the `photos.people` JSON column. |
| `tag_taxonomy` | decision | The tag tree. The database is its only home; the `*_taxonomy.json` files become an optional export. |
| `tag_embeddings` | derived | As today. |
| `embeddings` | derived | `photo_id`, model key, vector. Replaces the path-keyed `embedding_cache` and `photos.embedding`. |
| `suggestions` | derived | `photo_id`, tags, people, title, raw scores, model, created. Replaces the JSON cache file and the in-memory registry. |
| `generations` | infrastructure | `name`, `value` for photos, faces and taxonomy. Replaces `faces_generation` and `taxonomy_generation`. |
| `schema_version` | infrastructure | Migrations applied in order, from `tagpup.store.schema`. |
| `jobs` | infrastructure | id, kind, arguments, status, progress, message, created, finished. |

Each change ships as a migration with a dry run and a backup, and `tools/doctor.py` checks the library's invariants before and after.

## Frontend

- `web/common/` holds ES modules shared by both pages:
  - `api.js`: library-aware URLs and JSON. It replaces the monkeypatched `fetch` and image `src`.
  - `paths.js`, `vocabulary.js`, `unsaved.js`, `dialogs.js` and `status.js`.
- `web/tagpup/` and `web/tuner/` each have a `main.js` plus one module per feature: folder list, photo details, faces strip, Identify grid, tag tree. Each page keeps its state in one store object, not in 130 to 150 variables at the top of one closure.
- There is no build step: the browser loads native modules. Tests import the modules directly with `node --test`, and jsdom page loads are kept for whole flows.

## Testing

| What | How |
|---|---|
| core | Plain unit tests, milliseconds each. |
| store | A temporary library. |
| files, ml | Temporary files; few tests, slower. |
| services | One shared fixture, a temporary library with a photos folder, used by every service test (`tests/service_fixture.py`). |
| web | Flask's test client: no sockets, no ports, no sleeps. |
| pages | Modules directly; a few flows in jsdom. |
| performance | Baselines for the clicks that matter, recorded and re-run on demand in a sandbox (`tools/`). |

Target: the full check in under a minute.

## Where everything goes

| Today | Target |
|---|---|
| `scripts/paths.py` | `tagpup/core/paths.py` |
| `scripts/db.py` | `tagpup/store/db.py` |
| `scripts/exiftool_session.py` | `tagpup/files/exiftool_session.py` (not `exiftool.py`: it imports pyexiftool's `exiftool`, and a module of the same name reads as importing itself) |
| `scripts/identity.py` | `tagpup/files/identity.py` |
| `scripts/metadata.py` | `tagpup/files/metadata.py` (reading), `tagpup/core/vocabulary.py` (tags, people, captions), `tagpup/store/taxonomy.py` and `tagpup/store/faces.py` (the library's people, face names) |
| keyword writing in `tagpup_server.py` | `tagpup/files/keywords.py`, `tagpup/core/vocabulary.py` |
| `scripts/index.py` (`PhotoIndex`) | `tagpup/store/` (`schema`, `photos`, `faces`), `tagpup/ml/vector_index.py` |
| `scripts/taxonomy.py` | `tagpup/store/taxonomy.py`, `tagpup/core/vocabulary.py` |
| `scripts/faces.py` | `tagpup/ml/faces.py` (detection), `tagpup/core/clustering.py` (who is who) |
| `scripts/suggester.py` | `tagpup/core/suggest.py`, `tagpup/services/suggestions.py` |
| `scripts/embedder.py` | `tagpup/ml/clip.py` |
| `scripts/writer.py` | `tagpup/services/tagging.py` |
| `scripts/tagpup_server.py`, `scripts/tuner_server.py` | `tagpup/web/` (routes), `tagpup/services/` |
| `scripts/localserver.py` | `tagpup/web/security.py` (Waitress does the rest) |
| `scripts/reloader.py` | `tagpup/dev/reloader.py` |
| `tagpup_cli.py` | `tagpup/cli.py`; the file at the root stays as a launcher |
| `tagpup_gui.py`, `tagtuner.py` | one launcher for the one server |
| `runner.py` | `tagpup/desktop/runner.py`, over services |
| maintenance scripts in `scripts/` | stay, each a thin entry point on one scaffold: dry run, backup, apply, report |
| `measure_*`, `verify_workflow.py`, `generate_screenshots.py`, `prepare_test_environment.py` | `tools/`, sharing one sandbox module |
| `gui/`, `gui_tagpup/` | `web/tuner/`, `web/tagpup/`, `web/common/` |

A moved module leaves a short shim at its old name until nothing imports it, so each move is a small commit that changes no behaviour.

## Phases

Each phase ships on its own with the full check green. Nothing changes behaviour unless the phase says so.

### Phase 1: Foundations
- [x] This document, and a findings tracker in `docs/findings.md`.
- [x] `.gitattributes` for line endings.
- [x] The `tagpup/` package, with the foundation modules moved into it: paths, db, the ExifTool session, identity. One list of shipped files for every guard, and the layer guard.
- [x] `tagpup.config`: one loader, honouring `TAGPUP_HOME`, used by all 26 places that read `config.ini`.
- [x] `tagpup.logs`: file logs, and slow-request logging for both servers.
- [x] `tagpup.core.library.Library`: one name for a library and the files that belong to it, and backups beside the library.
- [x] The installed-copy launcher: `scripts/install_app.py`. Opt-in until the owner switches to it.

Exit: the guard tests for config, database connections, ExifTool and layers pass; both servers log to files; the app can run from an installed copy.

### Phase 2: Services
- [x] Delete TagTuner's eight unused routes: its copies of rename, time shift, delete, open in Explorer, rotate, save metadata and bulk tags (the TagPup page calls its own server's), and `/api/faces/recluster`, which no page calls.
- The rules, bottom-up. A service cannot live in `tagpup/` while what it calls is still in `scripts/`, and `metadata.py`, `index.py` and `taxonomy.py` each mix layers (files, store, rules). So the pure rules move first, then file reading into `tagpup.files`, then the tables into `tagpup.store` (phase 3 work the services pull forward):
  - [x] When a photo was taken: `tagpup.core.dates` (seven copies became one).
  - [x] The tag vocabulary: `tagpup.core.vocabulary` (55 hand-written splits became one reading).
  - [x] Reading photo files: `tagpup.files.metadata`. `metadata.py` split by layer: what the fields mean (tags, people, captions) went to `tagpup.core.vocabulary`, and the library's people and face names to `tagpup.store.taxonomy` and `tagpup.store.faces`. `scripts/metadata.py` joins them for the old callers.
  - [x] Writing keyword and caption fields: `tagpup.files.keywords`. Which person a bare name means is still resolved in `tagpup_server.py` before the write, until saving becomes a service.
  - [x] The tables, as the services need them: `tagpup.store` (taxonomy, photos, faces, people). `TagTaxonomy` moved into `tagpup.store.taxonomy`, and `scripts/taxonomy.py` is a name for it. The rest of `scripts/index.py` moves with phase 3.
- [x] `Result`: `tagpup.core.result.Result`, shaped by the first service. It is in core rather than a layer of its own: a plain value that every layer passes along.
- One service per user action. Start with the ones both servers implement (rename, rotate, delete, save metadata, bulk tags, time shift, indexing), then tag-tree edits, face identification and suggestions.
  - [x] Rotate: `tagpup.services.photos.rotate`.
  - [x] Delete: `tagpup.services.photos.delete`.
  - [x] Time shift: `tagpup.services.photos.shift_date_taken`.
  - [x] Smart Rename: `tagpup.services.photos.smart_rename`. The route still orders the photos, by the Date Taken in its folder cache.
  - [x] Save metadata (the photo panel): `tagpup.services.tagging.save_photo`. A tag that may not be set comes back as the Result's `refused`, which the route answers with 400.
  - [x] Bulk tags, and Apply All on a folder's suggestions: `tagpup.services.tagging.change_tags` and `add_tags`, one write loop.
  - [x] The library picker -- listing, choosing and creating a library, in both servers and the runner: one set of rules in `tagpup.core.library`. Creating one is still `create_library` in `tagpup_server.py`, until the schema moves into the store.
  - [x] Replacing a tag on every photo carrying it: `tagpup.services.tagging.replace_tag`. TagPup's tag-tree rename and delete, and TagTuner's merge and person rename, which reached into TagPup's server for it.
  - [x] The small routes both servers served: a photo (`tagpup.services.photos.page_copy`, upright and cached in TagPup, as stored in TagTuner), a face's crop (`photos.face_crop`, now kept in its row through the write lock), the people list (`tagpup.services.people.names`) and the folder dialog (`localserver.ask_for_folder`).
  - [x] The tag tree's edits: `tagpup.services.tags` (the tree view, create, the face and hidden switches, what a delete touches, delete, rename), over `tagpup.store.taxonomy`, which now makes every new node (`add_path`), moves and deletes branches, repairs the tree through the lock, and seeds a library's tree.
  - [x] TagTuner's Rename, Merge and Retire of a tag, and Rename Person: `tags.merge` and `tags.rename_person`. They now share the tree's code for changing a tag everywhere, and reach the same places (docs/findings.md, #38).
  - [x] Suggestions: `tagpup.jobs.suggestions`, the second job. It holds each library's runs per folder, the saved file and the only place it is named, starting and running a folder, retrying failed photos, and consensus before "completed". TagPup hands a run its folder scan and its suggester (`suggestion_work`), which stay in `scripts/` until the suggester and CLIP move (phase 3).
  - [x] Face identification's writes: `tagpup.services.faces` (name one face or many, unname, exclude, restore, automatch a photo or a folder, remove a folder). Each photo's people are kept by one function, `tagpup.store.photos.update_people`. Naming and excluding write through `tagpup.store.faces.accounted_write`, and return the fingerprints either side, so TagTuner takes their faces off its cached grids as it did. The grids themselves, and the Identify reads, are still TagTuner's.
  - [x] Adding folders. `tagpup.services.indexing.index_folder` runs the CLI's `index`, then `cluster-faces` when asked. The first job, `tagpup.jobs.indexing`, keeps one queue per library and indexes one folder at a time. The queue was TagTuner's; TagPup's index-start ran a thread per folder and now uses the same queue. Nothing about the queue is saved yet.
- Tests move down to the service level.

Exit: no action is implemented in two places, and migrated handlers only parse the request, call a service and reply.

### Phase 3: Store
On 2026-09-24, 210 SQL calls sat outside `tagpup.store`: 65 in `scripts/index.py`, 43 in TagTuner's server, 21 in `tagpup.services.faces`, 7 in TagPup's server, 7 in the desktop runner, and the rest in maintenance scripts, the embedder, the suggester and the writer. The schema was made in four places (docs/findings.md, #48).
- [x] The schema: `tagpup.store.schema`, the only place a table, column, index or trigger is made, as versioned migrations recorded in `schema_version`. The first brings a library of any age to today's tables; `PhotoIndex.load`, TagTuner's start-up, the runner, the tag tree and each request that names a library call it instead of making their own.
- [x] Generations: one `generations` table for photos, faces and the tag tree, kept by triggers, and one cache helper, `tagpup.store.generations.Cache`. The Suggest index reloads by the photos generation (#52).
- [x] `PhotoIndex` split: its SQL into `tagpup.store` (`photos`, `faces`, `embeddings`, `taxonomy`), the vector index into `tagpup.ml.vector_index`. `scripts/index.py` keeps the class as a composition of the two, with no SQL; the embedder and the suggester read through the store too. Checked against the old class on a copy of `photo_index`: the same rows, faces and neighbours, loaded in the same time.
- [x] The services' SQL: `tagpup.services.faces` calls store functions. Unmatching many faces reads them in one query, not one per face.
- [x] TagTuner's reads: the Identify queue and grids, the person grid, counts, the excluded list, the tag list and the people list (#49, #50), as store functions. Every read route answered byte for byte as before on copies of both libraries.
- [x] TagPup's reads, the runner, the CLI, the embedder, the suggester and the writer.
- [x] The maintenance scripts: each calls store functions, or retires once a dry run shows it has nothing left to do on either library. Five retired *(owner, 2026-09-24)*: `canonicalize_paths`, `repair_bare_person_tags`, `tidy_exclusion_reasons`, `restore_face_names`, `cache_all_crops`.
- [x] Guard: no SQL outside `tagpup.store` (`tests/test_sql_single_owner.py`). It finds all 43 statements in TagTuner's server as it was.
- [x] `tools/doctor.py`: the library's invariants, read-only, with counts (`tagpup.store.checks`). The schema is current; every face points at a photo; no named face is excluded; face names are among their photo's people (#42); the tree has no orphans; rows whose file is gone, by folder.

Exit: the servers contain no SQL.

### Phase 4: Data model
Each step that changes a table is a migration in `tagpup.store.schema` that takes a backup, is tried first on copies of both libraries, and is checked by `tools/doctor.py` before and after. Every index entry whose file was gone was dropped on 2026-09-24 *(owner)*, so the doctor starts clean on both libraries. In the order the inventory set, each after what it needs:
- [x] The tag tree in the database only. `TagTaxonomy` takes the library, not a JSON file whose name decides which library (#61, #13); `tagpup_cli.py export-tree` writes a copy on request. The files beside the owner's libraries held nothing the tables lack, but two flat tags no photo carries, left from before they were given paths; they were not brought in.
- [ ] `face_crops`: the crops out of `faces`, keyed by face id. 1.1 GB of `photo_index`, so the rebuild of `faces` that follows moves 6 KB less per face. Every face delete takes its crop.
- [ ] Photo ids. `photos` rebuilt with `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` and `path` unique; `faces.photo_id` in place of `faces.photo_path`, and every join by id (joins by path were case-sensitive where lookups were not). A photo the apps see gets a row the first time -- Suggest's faces and embeddings for photos never indexed included (`photos.ensure_row`). A rename is one update of `photos.path`.
- [ ] `embeddings`: one vector per photo and model, keyed by `photo_id` and all five model settings, with the stamp of what it was computed from. Replaces `photos.embedding` and `embedding_cache` (#62, #65).
- [ ] `photo_people`: each photo's people, written only by `tagpup.store.people.rebuild`, from its keywords, its faces and the tree, by the one rule in `tagpup.core.vocabulary`. Replaces `photos.people` and the seven patches of it (#63); tree edits that change who is a person rebuild what they change.
- [ ] `suggestions`: keyed by `photo_id`, with the model and the stamp they were made from. Replaces the JSON cache files and their re-keying on rename; a deleted photo takes its suggestions (#64). Run status stays in memory until `jobs`.
- [ ] Doctor rules for each: no crop without a face, no embedding or suggestion without a photo, people as the rule gives them.

Exit: nothing in the database is keyed by path, and `doctor.py` is clean on both libraries.

### Phase 5: One server
- Flask and Waitress: both ports, one process, services behind thin routes.
- The two standard-library servers and their launchers retire.
- Web tests use the test client.

Exit: one server process, and no test opens a socket to check logic it could check in-process.

### Phase 6: Pages
- `web/common/api.js` first, removing the monkeypatches; then the shared modules; then each page split by feature.

Exit: no page file over about 1,000 lines, and the two pages share every common helper.

### Phase 7: MCP
An MCP server, `tagpup.mcp`, so that Claude works with a library through the same services the apps use, rather than through a one-off script per question. Settling #42 in docs/findings.md took four throwaway scripts to learn that its 35 names sat on 28 rows of a folder deleted on purpose. Its reads need the repositories, so it follows phase 3; its order among phases 4 to 6 does not matter.
- An entry point beside web and cli, over stdio, in a process of its own. It opens the library `TAGPUP_HOME` names and never talks to a running app's port.
- Read tools first, read-only (`db.readonly_uri`): what a library holds, photos by folder, tag or person, a photo's row against its file, the faces in a photo, the consistency checks (face names missing from people, rows whose file is gone, rows that disagree with their file), and the query plan of a query.
- Answers give counts and ids by default, and paths and names only when asked: the library is photographs of real people, many of them minors.
- Write tools only by calling a service. Each is a dry run unless told to apply, backs the library up before it applies, and returns the service's `Result`.

Exit: every check in `tools/doctor.py`, and each question asked of the library while settling a finding, is one tool call. Every tool calls a service, and each has a test.

### Phase 8: Sync
A job that keeps each library in step with its folders. Today a row changes only when an app writes the photo or someone indexes its folder again, so the library drifts: files added outside the apps are missing, a deleted folder leaves its rows and face work behind (#42 and #47 in docs/findings.md), and a file edited elsewhere keeps a row describing what it used to hold. It needs photo ids (phase 4), which let a moved or renamed file keep its row, and its faces with it.
- `tagpup.jobs.sync`: for each indexed folder, compare what is on disk with the rows, by path, size and modified time. Content identity (the DocumentID) links a file that moved.
- What it finds, sorted: new files (indexed through the indexing job's queue), changed files (their rows re-read from the file, as `refresh_rows_from_files.py` does now), moved files (the row follows the file), and missing files.
- A missing file is reported, never removed on its own: a folder on an unplugged drive looks the same as a deleted one. Removing rows stays the owner's choice, and the report says which folders are wholly gone.
- It runs when a library opens and when asked, and may watch the indexed folders while an app runs. A scan that finds nothing costs one directory walk and no file reads.
- Each run reports what it changed, not what it looked at, and leaves a record the apps can show ("last in step: ...").

Exit: after files are added, edited, moved or deleted outside the apps, one sync brings the rows back in step. `tools/doctor.py` finds nothing it would change, except missing files it has reported.

## After the re-architecture

Behaviour changes queued behind the phases. They wait so that they land once, in the new code, rather than in both servers and again afterwards.

- Remove Folder chooses from the library's indexed folders, not from the folders on disk (docs/findings.md, #47). Each folder shows its photo count and whether it is still on disk, and one that is gone is the obvious one to pick. Removing takes the folder out of the library and never touches the files. The list comes from the same place as sync's report of missing folders (phase 8).

## Decisions

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-23 | The web layer moves to Flask and Waitress. |
| 2026-09-23 | One server process serves both apps, on the ports they use today. |
| 2026-09-23 | Photo ids arrive in phase 4, after the store layer exists. |
| 2026-09-23 | Face detection on sideways photos is tabled for a future discussion. |
| 2026-09-23 | PNG rotation is left as it is. |
| 2026-09-23 | `Library` lives in `core`: it only names files, and the web layer, which builds one per request, may not import `store`. `Result` moves to phase 2, so that its first real callers set its shape. |
| 2026-09-23 | `Result` lives in `core`, not in a layer of its own: it is a plain value every layer passes along, so it needs no place in the import rules. |
| 2026-09-24 | A service that reads returns what it read, not a `Result`, and raises `NotFound` (a route's 404) or `Refused` (400), which live beside `Result` in `tagpup.core.result`. |
| 2026-09-24 | Opening a photo, showing it in Explorer and the folder dialog stay web routes, not services: they act on the desktop of the machine the server runs on, and write nothing. |
