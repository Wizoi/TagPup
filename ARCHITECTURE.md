Where the code is going, why, and in what order. Agreed 2026-09-23. Known problems and review findings are tracked in [docs/findings.md](docs/findings.md).

[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) covers how to work in the code as it is today. This covers the shape it is moving to. For new code, this document wins.

## Why change

TagPup is organized by program: a TagPup server (`scripts/tagpup_server.py`, 4,088 lines), a TagTuner server (`scripts/tuner_server.py`, 5,326 lines), a CLI, a desktop runner, and 28 more modules in `scripts/`. Each carries its own copy of what a photo library is and does. On 2026-09-23:

- The two servers held 215 SQL calls and 74 routes, and 51 function names were defined in both. Eight TagTuner routes were never called by its own page; only tests reached them.
- ExifTool was opened from 22 places, images from 10 (with different orientation handling), and `config.ini` was read in 26.
- The database mixed copies of file metadata, decisions that exist nowhere else, and derived data, without saying which is which. `photos.people` was missing 1,626 names across the two libraries.
- A photo's identity was its path, so every rename had to re-point faces, embeddings and suggestions by hand.

Nearly every bug fixed that day had one of four shapes:

1. Many writers, no owner.
2. One fact stored in several places.
3. State cached in one process while three processes write the same database.
4. "Success" meaning "I tried".

Each time the codebase gained a single owner with a guard test (`db.py`, `paths.py`, `exiftool_session.py`, the tag vocabulary), a class of bug ended. This design does that for everything, on purpose, instead of after the fourth bug.

## Principles

1. **One owner per concern.** Every concern (a table, a file format, a rule) has exactly one module that implements it, and everything else calls that module. A guard test enforces each owner.
2. **Three kinds of data, one writer each.**
   - *File copies:* keywords, captions, dates, orientation, raw metadata, DocumentID. The photo file is the truth and the row is a cache of it. Only `sync_photo()` writes these, straight after a file is read or written.
   - *Decisions:* faces, the names people give them, exclusions, the tag tree. They exist only in the database and change only through services.
   - *Derived data:* people lists, embeddings, face crops, the vector index, Identify grids, suggestions, thumbnails. Feature code never writes them. One function rebuilds each, or it is computed on read, and caches are keyed by generation.
3. **A photo has an id.** Rows refer to photos by integer id, and the path is an attribute. A rename is one update.
4. **Every write reports what it changed.** Service functions return a `Result`: changed, attempted, skipped, errors.
5. **Context is explicit.** A `Library` object is passed to whatever needs it. There are no thread-locals and no class-level registries keyed by an implicit current library.
6. **Caches are keyed by library and generation.** Database triggers bump a generation when the data a cache depends on changes, whichever process changes it.
7. **The app you use runs from an installed copy, not the working tree.** Editing code never restarts it.

## Layers

```
   TagPup page    TagTuner page            web/: ES modules sharing web/common/
         \            /
   one web server (tagpup.web)     CLI (tagpup.cli)     scripts/, tools/
                \                        |                  /
                 +-----------------------+-----------------+
                 |                                         |
                 |                     jobs (tagpup.jobs): queue, status,
                 |                     cancel, worker processes for GPU work
                 v                                         v
        services (tagpup.services): one function per user action; the only writers
                 |
     +-----------+-----------+-------------+
     v           v           v             v
   core        store       files           ml
   rules       SQL         photo files     models
```

Imports only go down:

| Layer | Package | Owns | May import |
|---|---|---|---|
| core | `tagpup.core` | Pure rules: path identity, a library's name and the files that belong to it (`Library`), the tag vocabulary (leaf, root, person), people derivation, suggestion scoring, clustering decisions | nothing but `core` |
| config | `tagpup.config` | `TAGPUP_HOME`, `config.ini` and what it says: where the libraries are, which ExifTool, model settings, the library to open next. Read by entry points, which pass the values down | nothing |
| logs | `tagpup.logs` | Each program's log file in `data/logs/`. Set up by entry points | `config` |
| store | `tagpup.store` | The library database: connections and locks, schema and migrations, generations, one repository per table, caches keyed by generation, backups | `core` |
| files | `tagpup.files` | The photo files: ExifTool sessions, reading metadata, writing keyword, caption and orientation fields, identities, opening images (upright or as stored), crops and thumbnails | `core` |
| ml | `tagpup.ml` | Models: CLIP embeddings, face detection and embeddings, the vector index | `core`, `files` |
| services | `tagpup.services` | One function per user action. The only code that writes. Returns a `Result` | all of the above |
| jobs | `tagpup.jobs` | Background work: queue, status, cancel, persistence, worker processes for GPU work | `core`, `services` |
| entry points | `tagpup.web`, `tagpup.cli`, `scripts/`, `tools/` | HTTP, the command line, maintenance and development tools | `config`, `logs`, `services`, `jobs` (and `core` for formatting) |

Guard tests, each of which fails the build. The ones marked *exists* are in place; the rest arrive with their phase.

- Imports inside `tagpup/` go down the layers, and package code never imports an old module from `scripts/` by name. *Exists:* `tests/test_layers.py`.
- `sqlite3.connect` only in `tagpup.store.db`. *Exists:* `tests/test_db_access.py`.
- pyexiftool's classes constructed only in `tagpup.files.exiftool_session`. *Exists:* `tests/test_exiftool_single_owner.py`.
- Photo paths spelled and compared only by `tagpup.core.paths`. *Exists:* `tests/test_paths_single_owner.py`.
- Tags taken apart only by `tagpup.core.vocabulary`. *Exists:* `tests/test_vocabulary.py`.
- SQL only inside `tagpup.store`.
- `config.ini` read, and path settings resolved, only by `tagpup.config`; inside `tagpup/`, only it finds folders from `__file__`. *Exists:* `tests/test_config_single_owner.py`.
- ExifTool and `Image.open` only inside `tagpup.files`.
- Entry points import services and jobs, never store, files or ml directly.
- Every POST route returns a `Result`.
- Derived tables written only by their rebuild functions.
- Pages: `/api/` URLs built only by `web/common/api.js`. Tags split only by the vocabulary helpers (*exists:* `tests/frontend/tag-vocabulary.test.mjs`).

Every guard checks the same list of files, `tests/shipped_sources.py`: the launchers, `scripts/`, and `tagpup/`.

## Runtime

- **One server, two apps.** One Flask app, served by Waitress, answers on both ports used today: 8090 for TagPup, 8080 for TagTuner. The library comes from the URL as it does now, and becomes a `Library` object for the request. The Host and Origin check is a `before_request` hook.
- **Background jobs** (indexing, suggestions, clustering, refresh) run through one job runner per library, with status, cancel and persistence. GPU-heavy work runs in a worker process, as indexing does today through the CLI.
- **The installed copy.** `scripts/install_app.py` copies the code into a version folder under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TagPup` and writes launchers that run it. `TAGPUP_HOME` names the folder that holds `config.ini` and `data/`, with each library's backups and locks beside it. Updating is a deliberate step, installing again, and the two versions before stay to go back to. The auto-reloader is for development only.
- **Logs** go to `data/logs/`, one rotating file per program. Each holds everything the console shows, plus every request slower than a second with its time, and every failed request with its traceback.

## Data model

| Table | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `photos` | file copy | `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY; `path` UNIQUE, compared without case; `document_id`; `mtime`, `size`; `keywords`, `captions`, `raw_metadata`, `taken_at`, `orientation` as read from the file; `indexed_at`, NULL until indexed. Every photo the apps have looked at has a row, because faces need one to point at (today the suggester saves faces for photos with no row). |
| `faces` | decision | `id`; `photo_id` → `photos.id`; `box`; `embedding`; `name`; `name_source`; `excluded`; `excluded_reason`. |
| `face_crops` | derived | `face_id` → `faces.id`; the JPEG. Kept out of `faces`, so reading faces never drags 6 KB crops along. |
| `photo_people` | derived | `photo_id`, `name`, `source` (keyword or face). Rebuilt for a photo by one function whenever its keywords, its faces or the tag tree change. Replaces the `photos.people` JSON column. |
| `tag_taxonomy` | decision | The tag tree. The database is its only home; the `*_taxonomy.json` files become an optional export. |
| `tag_embeddings` | derived | As today. |
| `embeddings` | derived | `photo_id`, model key, vector. Replaces the path-keyed `embedding_cache` and `photos.embedding`. |
| `suggestions` | derived | `photo_id`, tags, people, title, raw scores, model, created. Replaces the JSON cache file and the in-memory registry. |
| `generations` | infrastructure | `name`, `value` for photos, faces and taxonomy. Replaces `faces_generation` and `taxonomy_generation`. |
| `schema_version` | infrastructure | Migrations applied in order, from `tagpup.store.schema`. |
| `jobs` | infrastructure | id, kind, arguments, status, progress, message, created, finished. |

Each change ships as a migration with a dry run and a backup, and `tools/doctor.py` checks the library's invariants before and after.

## Frontend

- `web/common/` holds ES modules shared by both pages:
  - `api.js`: library-aware URLs and JSON. It replaces the monkeypatched `fetch` and image `src`.
  - `paths.js`, `vocabulary.js`, `unsaved.js`, `dialogs.js` and `status.js`.
- `web/tagpup/` and `web/tuner/` each have a `main.js` plus one module per feature: folder list, photo details, faces strip, Identify grid, tag tree. Each page keeps its state in one store object, not in 130 to 150 variables at the top of one closure.
- There is no build step: the browser loads native modules. Tests import the modules directly with `node --test`, and jsdom page loads are kept for whole flows.

## Testing

| What | How |
|---|---|
| core | Plain unit tests, milliseconds each. |
| store | A temporary library. |
| files, ml | Temporary files; few tests, slower. |
| services | One shared fixture, a temporary library with a photos folder, used by every service test. |
| web | Flask's test client: no sockets, no ports, no sleeps. |
| pages | Modules directly; a few flows in jsdom. |
| performance | Baselines for the clicks that matter, recorded and re-run on demand in a sandbox (`tools/`). |

Target: the full check in under a minute.

## Where everything goes

| Today | Target |
|---|---|
| `scripts/paths.py` | `tagpup/core/paths.py` |
| `scripts/db.py` | `tagpup/store/db.py` |
| `scripts/exiftool_session.py` | `tagpup/files/exiftool_session.py` (not `exiftool.py`: it imports pyexiftool's `exiftool`, and a module of the same name reads as importing itself) |
| `scripts/identity.py` | `tagpup/files/identity.py` |
| `scripts/metadata.py` | `tagpup/files/metadata.py` (reading), `tagpup/core/vocabulary.py` (tags, people, captions) |
| keyword writing in `tagpup_server.py` | `tagpup/files/keywords.py`, `tagpup/core/vocabulary.py` |
| `scripts/index.py` (`PhotoIndex`) | `tagpup/store/` (`schema`, `photos`, `faces`), `tagpup/ml/vector_index.py` |
| `scripts/taxonomy.py` | `tagpup/store/taxonomy.py`, `tagpup/core/vocabulary.py` |
| `scripts/faces.py` | `tagpup/ml/faces.py` (detection), `tagpup/core/clustering.py` (who is who) |
| `scripts/suggester.py` | `tagpup/core/suggest.py`, `tagpup/services/suggestions.py` |
| `scripts/embedder.py` | `tagpup/ml/clip.py` |
| `scripts/writer.py` | `tagpup/services/tagging.py` |
| `scripts/tagpup_server.py`, `scripts/tuner_server.py` | `tagpup/web/` (routes), `tagpup/services/` |
| `scripts/localserver.py` | `tagpup/web/security.py` (Waitress does the rest) |
| `scripts/reloader.py` | `tagpup/dev/reloader.py` |
| `tagpup_cli.py` | `tagpup/cli.py`; the file at the root stays as a launcher |
| `tagpup_gui.py`, `tagtuner.py` | one launcher for the one server |
| `runner.py` | `tagpup/desktop/runner.py`, over services |
| maintenance scripts in `scripts/` | stay, each a thin entry point on one scaffold: dry run, backup, apply, report |
| `measure_*`, `verify_workflow.py`, `generate_screenshots.py`, `prepare_test_environment.py` | `tools/`, sharing one sandbox module |
| `gui/`, `gui_tagpup/` | `web/tuner/`, `web/tagpup/`, `web/common/` |

A moved module leaves a short shim at its old name until nothing imports it, so each move is a small commit that changes no behaviour.

## Phases

Each phase ships on its own with the full check green. Nothing changes behaviour unless the phase says so.

### Phase 1: Foundations
- [x] This document, and a findings tracker in `docs/findings.md`.
- [x] `.gitattributes` for line endings.
- [x] The `tagpup/` package, with the foundation modules moved into it: paths, db, the ExifTool session, identity. One list of shipped files for every guard, and the layer guard.
- [x] `tagpup.config`: one loader, honouring `TAGPUP_HOME`, used by all 26 places that read `config.ini`.
- [x] `tagpup.logs`: file logs, and slow-request logging for both servers.
- [x] `tagpup.core.library.Library`: one name for a library and the files that belong to it, and backups beside the library.
- [x] The installed-copy launcher: `scripts/install_app.py`. Opt-in until the owner switches to it.

Exit: the guard tests for config, database connections, ExifTool and layers pass; both servers log to files; the app can run from an installed copy.

### Phase 2: Services
- [x] Delete TagTuner's eight unused routes: its copies of rename, time shift, delete, open in Explorer, rotate, save metadata and bulk tags (the TagPup page calls its own server's), and `/api/faces/recluster`, which no page calls.
- The rules, bottom-up. A service cannot live in `tagpup/` while what it calls is still in `scripts/`, and `metadata.py`, `index.py` and `taxonomy.py` each mix layers (files, store, rules). So the pure rules move first, then file reading into `tagpup.files`, then the tables into `tagpup.store` (phase 3 work the services pull forward):
  - [x] When a photo was taken: `tagpup.core.dates` (seven copies became one).
  - [x] The tag vocabulary: `tagpup.core.vocabulary` (55 hand-written splits became one reading).
- `tagpup.result.Result`, shaped by the first services that return it.
- One service per user action. Start with the ones both servers implement (rename, rotate, delete, save metadata, bulk tags, time shift, indexing), then tag-tree edits, face identification and suggestions.
- Tests move down to the service level.

Exit: no action is implemented in two places, and migrated handlers only parse the request, call a service and reply.

### Phase 3: Store
- SQL moves into repositories as the services come out. Guard: no SQL outside `tagpup.store`.
- One `generations` table and one cache helper; versioned migrations.
- `tools/doctor.py`.

Exit: the servers contain no SQL.

### Phase 4: Data model
- Photo ids and `faces.photo_id`; every photo the apps have seen has a row.
- The `face_crops`, `photo_people`, `embeddings` and `suggestions` tables; the tag tree in the database only.
- Each as a migration with a dry run, a backup, and a doctor check before and after.

Exit: nothing in the database is keyed by path, and `doctor.py` is clean on both libraries.

### Phase 5: One server
- Flask and Waitress: both ports, one process, services behind thin routes.
- The two standard-library servers and their launchers retire.
- Web tests use the test client.

Exit: one server process, and no test opens a socket to check logic it could check in-process.

### Phase 6: Pages
- `web/common/api.js` first, removing the monkeypatches; then the shared modules; then each page split by feature.

Exit: no page file over about 1,000 lines, and the two pages share every common helper.

## Decisions

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-23 | The web layer moves to Flask and Waitress. |
| 2026-09-23 | One server process serves both apps, on the ports they use today. |
| 2026-09-23 | Photo ids arrive in phase 4, after the store layer exists. |
| 2026-09-23 | Face detection on sideways photos is tabled for a future discussion. |
| 2026-09-23 | PNG rotation is left as it is. |
| 2026-09-23 | `Library` lives in `core`: it only names files, and the web layer, which builds one per request, may not import `store`. `Result` moves to phase 2, so that its first real callers set its shape. |
